; The application root is used to locate the database file. The sub-directory "db" is always appended.
;
; During normal application execution, the directory from which the app is running is used.
; This setting is only used when the path to the executable includes:
;		"bin\debug", "bin\x86\debug", "bin\release", or "bin\x86\release".
